### Event Description ###

As part of running the ACM club, we need to figure out ways to raise money. One such way would be to host a LAN party with a certain amount of buy-in, and the potential for prizes at the end for incentive. Assumedly, we would be able to use the Keck Lab resources for no charge, and if we host it on a low traffic day (say, Friday night), there would be no disruption of routine.
