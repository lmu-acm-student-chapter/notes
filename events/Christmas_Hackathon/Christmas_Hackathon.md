### Results ###

Due to a last minute announcement and the fact that it was still holiday season, few people showed up for the hackathon. However, the people that were there got a lot done, and spent time socializing and programming.

### Conclusion ###

Though the event was smaller than anticipated, it still produced successful results. Perhaps next time there can be more notice of the event, better timing, and greater participation
