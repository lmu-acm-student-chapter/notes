### Basic Formatting ###

### NOTE: If you have a suggestion for how a template could be improved, please discuss with the issue tracker before editing. ###

This is a template for all the documents in this repository in an attempt for consistent layouts. All other templates should be based off of this file.

Refer to [Github Flavored Markdown] Refer to aforementioned link for anything formatting questions not detailed in here.

Make sure all links are reference style, include references at the bottom of the section. Try to make references unique and descriptive.

Two linebreaks should be used to separate *EVERYTHING*.

Use only \*s for *italics* or **bold text**. No underscores. 

There should not be **ANY** hard tabs in this at all. 

Sections should be separated by horizontal rules.

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
    printf("Hi! I'm a syntax highlighting example!");
}
```
