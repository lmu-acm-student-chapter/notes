Okay so I can't draw very well, but the intent is that:

* On the front, we have "LMU COMPUTER SCIENCE" right on the center of the chest in a not-too-large rectangle, with "LMU" very large and "COMPUTER SCIENCE" in white text on a dark background.

* The wearer's left sleeve has the ACM logo.

* The wearer's right side has a (possibly rainbow-colored).  Side printing is all the rage now, and we want to be cool.

* The middle of the back is a Dining Philosopher's sketch. This can be made artsy if we want.

* Optionally, the back of the neck can have a little regex or formula or something. I showed a regex to match prime numbers in unary, but this can be anything, or nothing need appear here at all.
