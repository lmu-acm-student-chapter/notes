LMU ACM Student Chapter
=====

This repository will host information about our chapter:
  * meeting notes
  * schedules
  * officer information
  * etc
  
Keeping this stuff on github will:
  1. Encourage all chapter members to use github
  2. Allow for contributions and changes to our notes

That said, bear in mind that this is a **public** repository.
